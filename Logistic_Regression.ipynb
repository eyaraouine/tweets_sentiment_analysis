    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",

    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp/supplement/YLuAg/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace).\n",

    "Implement gradient descent function.\n",
    "* The number of iterations 'num_iters\" is the number of times that you'll use the entire training set.\n",
    "* For each iteration, you'll calculate the cost function using all training examples (there are 'm' training examples), and for all features.\n",
    "* Instead of updating a single weight $\\theta_i$ at a time, we can update all the weights in the column vector:  \n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\theta} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\theta_0\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "\\theta_1\n",

    "\\\\ \n",
    "\\vdots\n",
    "\\\\ \n",
    "\\theta_n\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ has dimensions (n+1, 1), where 'n' is the number of features, and there is one more element for the bias term $\\theta_0$ (note that the corresponding feature value $\\mathbf{x_0}$ is 1).\n",
    "* The 'logits', 'z', are calculated by multiplying the feature matrix 'x' with the weight vector 'theta'.  $z = \\mathbf{x}\\mathbf{\\theta}$\n",
    "    * $\\mathbf{x}$ has dimensions (m, n+1) \n",
    "    * $\\mathbf{\\theta}$: has dimensions (n+1, 1)\n",
    "    * $\\mathbf{z}$: has dimensions (m, 1)\n",
    "* The prediction 'h', is calculated by applying the sigmoid to each element in 'z': $h(z) = sigmoid(z)$, and has dimensions (m,1).\n",
    "* The cost function $J$ is calculated by taking the dot product of the vectors 'y' and 'log(h)'.  Since both 'y' and 'h' are column vectors (m,1), transpose the vector to the left, so that matrix multiplication of a row vector with column vector performs the dot product.\n",
    "$$J = \\frac{-1}{m} \\times \\left(\\mathbf{y}^T \\cdot log(\\mathbf{h}) + \\mathbf{(1-y)}^T \\cdot log(\\mathbf{1-h}) \\right)$$\n",
    "* The update of theta is also vectorized.  Because the dimensions of $\\mathbf{x}$ are (m, n+1), and both $\\mathbf{h}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ are (m, 1), we need to transpose the $\\mathbf{x}$ and place it on the left in order to perform matrix multiplication, which then yields the (n+1, 1) answer we need:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\theta} = \\mathbf{\\theta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\times \\left( \\mathbf{x}^T \\cdot \\left( \\mathbf{h-y} \\right) \\right)$$"
